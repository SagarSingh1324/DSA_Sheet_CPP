// A permutation of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.

// For example, for arr = [1,2,3], the following are all the permutations of arr: [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1].

int main()
{
 
return 0; 
}


// The next permutation of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater permutation of its integer. 
// More formally, if all the permutations of the array are sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, 
// then the next permutation of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container. 
// If such arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).

// For example, the next permutation of arr = [1,2,3] is [1,3,2].
